            <p>Dinuguan , which comes from the root word dugo (meaning "blood"), is a savory Filipino stew made of bite-sized pork cooked in pig's blood, vinegar, and spices, including garlic, onions, and chili peppers. Fondly referred to as "chocolate meat," the pork blood stew is also called tid tad in the Kapampangan region, sinugaok in Batangas, dinardaraan in the Ilocos area, dugo dugo in Cebuano, and tinumis in Bulacan and Nueva Ecija provinces.
            It's commonly served as a main meal with steamed rice or as a midday snack with a side of puto rice cakes to dip and soak up the savory gravy.</p>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First, heat the oil in a pot. Sauté the chopped onions for about 30 seconds. Add the minced garlic and cook until the onions soften and start to caramelize. This step builds the base flavor for your dinuguan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next, add the cubed pork shoulder and ears into the pot. Sauté the pork for 3 to 5 minutes until it starts to brown. This helps to seal in the pork juices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour ithe vinegar into the cooking pot. Quickly stir. This is an important ingredient that gives the dish its sour flavor. It also reduces the gamey taste of the blood.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour in the water and bring it to a boil. Add the dried bay leaves and lemongrass. Let the mixture re-boil to blend the flavors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Simmer for about an hour. Check occasionally and add more water if needed. This slow cooking process ensures the pork becomes tender and flavorful.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the long green peppers and pour in the pork blood. Stir the mixture and continue cooking over low to medium heat for 15 minutes, stirring every 3 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, add the granulated white sugar and season with salt and ground black pepper to taste. Stir well to combine all the flavors. Transfer the dinuguan to a serving bowl and enjoy it with rice or rice cakes! Enjoy!
